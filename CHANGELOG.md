# Changelog

## 0.2.0

Breaking.

- The vocabulary of effects and the driver interfaces move to `is_effects`:
  `PathInRepo`, `FileText`, `Args`, `ReadResult`, `Wrote`, `ExecResult`,
  `Outcome`, and `FileDriver` and `ProgramDriver`. A driver depends on
  `is_effects` alone and sees no run, journey path or decision. This package
  depends on `is_effects` and nothing else of ours.
- `Tool`, `answeredBy`, `Reply` and `ExecResult.output` move to `is_tool`
  (as `Answer`, `answeredBy`, `Reply` and `execResultOutput`), so a host can
  take this up before its tools move to `is_tools_api` 0.2.
- `Executable` wraps an `is_effects` `ProgramName`, compares by it, and has
  `Executable.parse`; `Starts.program` is the `ProgramName`.
- `Allow` and `Deny` take `by: DecidedBy.rules` or `DecidedBy.person`, so
  the record tells the rules' decision from the person's.
- Drivers report while a run is underway, on `JourneyPath.underway`.
- `Settled` is renamed `Returned`: a run goes out and comes back with its
  outcome, so a run's entries are `Decided`, then `Returned`.

## 0.1.0

- First release: `Result` (`Run`, `Done`, `Failed`), the closed set of
  programs (`ReadFile`, `WriteFile`, `Executable`) and their `Reach`,
  `Outcome` (`Ran`, `Refused`), `FileDriver` and `ProgramDriver`,
  `ExecResult`, and `PathInRepo`.
- `JourneyPath`, `JourneyPathId`, `Airlock`, `Decision` (`Allow`, `Deny`)
  and `Entry` (`Decided`, `Settled`, `Narrowed`): `Run.next` is the one way
  to carry out a run, and each run is decided and recorded before its driver
  is reached, and recorded again before its outcome flows on. Each narrowing
  is recorded, granted or not, before the new journey path exists.
- `Tool`, `answeredBy` and `Reply`: a tool's code attached to its
  `is_tools_api` definition, and a call followed to what the model is told.
